## Plagiarism

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the
[plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/Administrative/blob/master/plagiarism.md),
specifically on using work you find online and on work you do with other
students.

We give assignments like this to give you the opportunity to review the material
in class in a practical manner. By building something using what you've learned
in class, you'll be reviewing the material and gaining a deeper understanding of
it.

These assignments are similar to those you can expect when applying for a job,
either in the form of a take-home coding challenge or an in-person technical
interview. So it's important that you put in your best effort now and challenge
yourself to do this assignment on your own.

If you are struggling with the material, that's alright! That's why you're here.
First, try reviewing the previous lessons and exercises. Go easy on yourself,
you're still learning! If you're still struggling after that, come to office
hours and ask an instructor for help. They're here to help you!

Don't copy and paste from another source or another student or the solution
branch. That's just going to put you at a disadvantage when you're interviewing
for a job.
